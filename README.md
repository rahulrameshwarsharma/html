*starting html coding on 07 Jan 2024, Sunday.*
-   Today I have completed **CSS**, So thought to revise html quickly before jumping to javaScript.

### Alternatives of HTML languages:
- *markdown*, *latex* etc... are also mark up languages which can be used as an alternative of HTML but html is the most supported language in the browser, so we use html in general.

### Attributes:
-   There are compulsory attributes and non-compulsory attributes.
    - for example, In "<a>" tag "href" is compulsory attribute whereas "target" is non-compulsory attribute.

- If any attribute doesn't affect the basic functionality of the tag then it is non-compulsory attribute, as the browser will consider any default value on behalf of it.

- If any attribute affect the basic functionality of the tag i.e., "href" attribute in <a> tag, it affects the working so it is the compulsory attribute.

### Comments
- ```<!-- For single and multiline comments, this is the way -->```
