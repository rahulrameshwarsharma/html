*starting html coding on 07 Jan 2024, Sunday.*
-   Today I have completed **CSS**, So thought to revise html quickly before jumping to javaScript.

# Alternatives of HTML languages:
- *markdown*, *latex* etc... are also mark up languages which can be used as an alternative of HTML but html is the most supported language in the browser, so we use html in general.
