### Alternatives of HTML languages
- *markdown*, *latex* etc... are also mark up languages which can be used as an alternative of HTML but html is the most supported language in the browser, so we use html in general.

### Attributes:
-   There are compulsory attributes and non-compulsory attributes.
    - for example, In "<a>" tag "href" is compulsory attribute whereas "target" is non-compulsory attribute.

- If any attribute doesn't affect the basic functionality of the tag then it is non-compulsory attribute, as the browser will consider any default value on behalf of it.

- If any attribute affect the basic functionality of the tag i.e., "href" attribute in <a> tag, it affects the working so it is the compulsory attribute.

### Comments
-  ```<!-- For single and multiline comments, this is the way -->```

### <hr>
- This tag display a horizontal line

### <br />
- This tag gives line brake and shift text to next line.
- The better way to write this tag is ```"<br />"``` because in react it will show error if written ```"<br />"```.

### <pre>
- This tag is used to solve to peom problem, it can print star or any other patern.
    - Any spaces that given inside the ```"<pre>"``` tag are displayed as it is by browser.
    - This tag is also used for writting codes of other languages to display in browser screen. for example: -
        - ```<pre>console.log("hello world");</pre>```
